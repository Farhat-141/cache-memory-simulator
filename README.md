CACHE MEMORY SIMULATOR
An interactive web-based simulation tool for visualizing cache memory replacement algorithms.

Overview
This project simulates how cache memory works using different replacement algorithms. It offers an animated, interactive interface to help users understand the behavior and performance of caching strategies like FIFO, LRU, LFU, and Random. It's especially useful for educational purposes in computer architecture or systems design courses.

Features
Step-by-step simulation of memory access sequences

Auto-run mode to process entire sequences automatically

Real-time statistics:

Total accesses

Cache hits and misses

Hit and miss rates

Supports the following cache replacement algorithms:

FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

LRU (Least Recently Used)

LFU (Least Frequently Used)

Random Replacement

Visual progress bar and animated cache slot highlighting

Algorithm descriptions and explanations

Modern, responsive UI using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3 (Custom animations and styles)

Vanilla JavaScript (No external libraries)

Use Cases
This simulator is ideal for:

Demonstrating cache memory behavior in computer architecture classes

Experimenting with and comparing replacement policies

Understanding CPU memory hierarchy design concepts

How to Use
Clone or download the repository.

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

Set the following parameters:

Cache size

Replacement algorithm

Memory address access sequence

Use the buttons to:

Initialize: Set up the simulation

Step Forward: Advance one memory access

Auto Run: Run through the full sequence automatically

Reset: Restart the simulation
